 *
 * \note    This text shall only show you, how such a \"note\" section
 *          is looking. There is nothing which really needs your notice,
 *          so you do not really need to read this section.

 * \param[in]     a    Description of parameter a.
 * \param[out]    b    Description of the parameter b.
 * \param[in,out] c    Description of the parameter c.
